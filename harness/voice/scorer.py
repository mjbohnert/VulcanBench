"""Mode-blind scoring for the voice suite.

Validity of the voice-tax comparison rests on one property: the scorer is
**byte-identical between text mode and audio mode**. There is exactly one
entry point (:func:`score_response`) taking ``(item, response_text)`` — it
has no knowledge of which modality produced the text.

Pipeline: normalize → exact/alias match → optional LLM judge for free-form
phrasings. Normalization folds case, punctuation, articles, and number words
(``"eighty-eight"`` → ``"88"``) so that STT rendering differences ("42" vs
"forty-two") cannot masquerade as accuracy differences. The judge model is
pinned in the run manifest and the rubric lives at
``tasks/voice-v1/RUBRIC.md``.
